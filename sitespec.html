            <h1>Pizza Ordering Website Specifications</h1>

            <h2>Overview</h2>
            <p>The Pizza Ordering Website allows users to order pizzas online with a user-friendly interface. Customers can customize their pizzas, choose from various sizes, crust types, and toppings, and place their orders for delivery or pickup.</p>

            <h2>Inspiration</h2>
            <p>My goal in this project was to create a combination of a traditional pizza restaurant in my country <a href="https://lucatraditie.ro/" target="_blank">Luca Traditie</a> and Domino's pizza only because of how easy it is to order from them.</p>

            <h2>Details about my website</h2>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Client or subject:</strong> Pizza</li>
                <li><strong>Title:</strong> Pizza Paradise</li>
                <li><strong>Purpose:</strong> To make a nice website where the user can see the big range of products and also an easy ordering system for the customer</li>
                <li><strong>Target audience:</strong> Any person that is hungry for a pizza, any age mostly.</li>
                <li><strong>Content of the website:</strong> Pizza and the story behind the specific traditional pizza maker.</li>
            </ul>

            <h2>Description</h2>
            <p><strong>The business:</strong> A traditional pizza restaurant that is owned by a family from generations.</p>
            <p><strong>What is the topic?</strong> The topic is to create a company that would serve well clients, that would listen very carefully to their needs, this is why I created the feedback page. A page that I wish would exist on any possible company, because there are always so many things to improve.</p>
            <p><strong>Who is the target audience:</strong> Any person, any sex, any age group. Basically everyone that is hungry for some good pizza.</p>
            <p><strong>Existing website:</strong> Yes! My goal was to combine two pizza companies, one from my home country, Luca <a href="https://lucatraditie.ro/" target="_blank">Luca Traditie</a> and the other one being Domino's pizza. The idea behind this was to bring to the customer both the traditional feeling, but also the easiness to order a pizza and to have it delivered quite shortly.</p>

            <h2>Features</h2>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Menu:</strong> Display a list of pizzas with images, descriptions, ingredients and prices.</li>
                <li><strong>Offers:</strong> Highlight any ongoing promotions or deals.</li>
                <li><strong>Ordering System:</strong> Users can add pizzas and the system will tell them how much it is and eventually it will give an email/message to the kitchen of the pizza restaurant to prepare as fast as possible.</li>
                <li><strong>The story of the pizza shop:</strong> The user can see here how the business started and how it continued to get larger with time.</li>
                <li><strong>Feedback:</strong> An essential page for every commercial entity. Why? Because it gives valuable feedback that can help improve the company.</li>
                <li><strong>Contact:</strong> A very simple form, where the user or any other potential partner can contact the owner.</li>
            </ul>

            <h2>Conclusion</h2>
            <p>This specification outlines the requirements and features necessary for developing a pizza ordering website. The goal is to create a seamless and enjoyable ordering experience for users.</p>
